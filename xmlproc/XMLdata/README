This is a set of simple XML inputs (actually, configuration files for
MacOS and its applications).  When parsed by XMLproc, the "failing"
files issue warnings and errors, while the "passing" files work just fine.  

By comparing the coverage of the "passing" and the "failing" files,
you should be able to locate the origin of the messages.
